## 🚀 TIPM v3.0 - Tariff Impact Propagation Model

**An AI-Powered tool for Economic analysis & insights**

### 📊 **Data Overview**
- **Total Countries**: {len(countries)}
- **Data Source**: US Government Official Tariff Data
- **Coverage**: EO + HTS + USTR + CBP

### 🌍 **Countries Covered**
{', '.join(countries[:10])}... and {len(countries)-10} more

### 🔬 **Analysis Methodology**
Our tariff impact analysis uses sophisticated algorithms that process official US government data through multiple calculation layers:

1. **Reciprocal Tariff Calculation**: Base duty rates + reciprocal add-ons from Executive Orders
2. **Sector Impact Analysis**: HTS chapter grouping with weighted average tariff rates  
3. **Economic Impact Modeling**: Trade disruption, price elasticity, and employment effects
4. **Risk Assessment**: Critical/High/Medium/Low impact classification

### 🏛️ **Data Verification**
All tariff data is sourced from official US government sources, providing comprehensive coverage of countries affected by US trade policies.

### 🔗 **Full Application**
The complete TIPM v3.0 application with interactive dashboard is available at the GitHub repository.
