# 🌍 TIPM: Tariff Impact Propagation Model

An advanced AI system for predicting how tariffs impact global markets, supply chains, and populations using a sophisticated 6-layer machine learning architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- **186 Countries**: Comprehensive global tariff analysis
- **12 Economic Sectors**: From Agriculture to Technology
- **6-Layer ML Architecture**: Policy → Trade → Industry → Firm → Consumer → Geopolitical
- **Real Data Integration**: Based on actual Trump-era tariff policies
- **Interactive Analysis**: Gradio-powered web interface

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### Economic Impact Analysis
- **Trade Flow Disruption**: Graph neural networks model supply chain effects
- **Industry Response**: Multi-output regression for sectoral impacts  
- **Employment Effects**: Survival analysis for firm-level job impacts
- **Consumer Pricing**: Bayesian time series for price propagation
- **Geopolitical Feedback**: NLP analysis of social and political responses

### Advanced Features
- **Confidence Scoring**: AI-generated reliability metrics for all predictions
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of economic vulnerabilities
- **Sector-Specific Analysis**: Detailed breakdown by industry vertical
- **Bilateral Trade Modeling**: Country-to-country impact assessment

## 📊 Architecture Layers

1. **Policy Trigger**: NLP processing of tariff announcements
2. **Trade Flow**: Graph neural networks for supply chain analysis  
3. **Industry Response**: Multi-output regression for sectoral impacts
4. **Firm Impact**: Survival analysis for employment effects
5. **Consumer Impact**: Bayesian time series for price impacts
6. **Geopolitical**: Transformer NLP for social response prediction

## 🔬 Use Cases

- **Policy Analysis**: Evaluate proposed tariff policies before implementation
- **Economic Research**: Academic study of trade policy impacts
- **Business Intelligence**: Corporate strategic planning for trade disruptions
- **Risk Management**: Financial sector assessment of economic vulnerabilities
- **Educational Tool**: Interactive learning about global trade dynamics

## 📈 Sample Insights

The model can predict outcomes like:
- "25% tariff on Chinese technology imports → 15% price increase in consumer electronics → 8% reduction in discretionary spending → 3% GDP growth slowdown"
- "EU automotive tariffs → Supply chain restructuring → 12,000 job shifts → €2.3B economic adjustment costs"

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **ML Frameworks**: PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, transformers
- **Graph Analysis**: NetworkX, PyTorch Geometric  
- **Time Series**: Prophet, statsmodels, ARIMA
- **NLP**: HuggingFace transformers, spaCy
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Gradio
- **Data**: Real Trump tariff data, UN Comtrade, World Bank, OECD
