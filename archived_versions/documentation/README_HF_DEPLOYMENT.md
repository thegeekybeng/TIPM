## ðŸ“Š Overview

TIPM is an AI-powered system for predicting the economic impact of tariffs across global markets, supply chains, and populations. This demo analyzes how tariffs affect countries and sectors using real Trump-era tariff data.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- **Country Impact Analysis**: Assess economic disruption across 25+ countries
- **Sector Analysis**: Analyze 18 major economic sectors
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorize countries by vulnerability levels
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Clear charts showing country positioning
- **Export Capabilities**: Download analysis results as CSV
- **Standardized Formula**: Mathematically consistent impact calculations

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Metrics

- **Economic Disruption %**: Percentage of economic activity disrupted by tariffs
- **GDP Impact**: Estimated GDP loss in USD billions
- **Trade Volume**: Bilateral trade volume with USA in USD billions annually
- **Sector Vulnerability**: Industry-specific impact assessments

## ðŸ”¬ Technology Stack

TIPM uses a 6-layer ML architecture:

1. **Policy Trigger Layer**: NLP processing of tariff announcements
2. **Trade Flow Layer**: Graph neural networks for supply chain analysis
3. **Industry Response Layer**: Multi-output regression for sectoral impacts
4. **Firm Impact Layer**: Survival analysis for employment effects
5. **Consumer Impact Layer**: Bayesian time series for price impacts
6. **Geopolitical Layer**: Transformer NLP for social response prediction

## ðŸ“Š Sample Results

**Major Economies Analysis:**

- China (67% tariff): ~40.6% economic disruption
- Germany (25% tariff): ~22.8% economic disruption
- Japan (18% tariff): ~19.4% economic disruption
- Singapore (10% tariff): ~15.8% economic disruption

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes
