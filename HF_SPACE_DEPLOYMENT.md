# 🚀 Hugging Face Space Deployment Guide for TIPM v3.0

## 📋 **Complete Step-by-Step Process**

### **Step 1: Create the Space**

```bash
# Create a new Hugging Face Space with Gradio SDK
hf repo create thegeekybeng/tipm-app --repo-type space --space_sdk gradio
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Successfully created thegeekybeng/tipm-app on the Hub.
Your repo is now available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/thegeekybeng/tipm-app
```

### **Step 2: Clone the Space Locally**

```bash
# Remove any existing directory with same name
rm -rf tipm-app

# Clone the HF space to your local machine
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/thegeekybeng/tipm-app

# Navigate into the space directory
cd tipm-app
```

### **Step 3: Add Your Application Files**

```bash
# Copy your app files from the main project
cp ../app.py .
cp ../requirements.txt .

# Verify files are copied
ls -la
```

**Expected Files:**

- `app.py` (Gradio application)
- `requirements.txt` (Python dependencies)
- `.gitattributes` (HF auto-generated)
- `README.md` (HF auto-generated)

### **Step 4: Commit and Push**

```bash
# Add all files to git
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "TIPM v3.0: Complete Gradio app with authoritative US tariff data"

# Push to Hugging Face Space
git push
```

**Expected Output:**

```

## 🚀 TIPM v3.0 - Tariff Impact Propagation Model

**An AI-Powered tool for Economic analysis & insights**

### 📊 **Data Overview**
- **Total Countries**: {len(countries)}
- **Data Source**: US Government Official Tariff Data
- **Coverage**: EO + HTS + USTR + CBP

### 🌍 **Countries Covered**
{', '.join(countries[:10])}... and {len(countries)-10} more

### 🔬 **Analysis Methodology**
Our tariff impact analysis uses sophisticated algorithms that process official US government data through multiple calculation layers:

1. **Reciprocal Tariff Calculation**: Base duty rates + reciprocal add-ons from Executive Orders
2. **Sector Impact Analysis**: HTS chapter grouping with weighted average tariff rates
3. **Economic Impact Modeling**: Trade disruption, price elasticity, and employment effects
4. **Risk Assessment**: Critical/High/Medium/Low impact classification

### 🏛️ **Data Verification**
All tariff data is sourced from official US government sources, providing comprehensive coverage of countries affected by US trade policies.

### 🔗 **Full Application**
The complete TIPM v3.0 application with interactive dashboard is available at the GitHub repository.

### **requirements.txt** (Dependencies)

```
gradio>=4.0.0
pandas>=2.0.0
```

## 🎯 **Complete One-Line Commands**

### **Full Deployment Script**

```bash
# Create space, clone, add files, commit, push, and clean up
hf repo create thegeekybeng/tipm-app --repo-type space --space_sdk gradio && \
rm -rf tipm-app && \
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/thegeekybeng/tipm-app && \
cd tipm-app && \
cp ../app.py . && \
cp ../requirements.txt . && \
git add . && \
git commit -m "TIPM v3.0: Complete Gradio app with authoritative US tariff data" && \
git push && \
cd .. && \
rm -rf tipm-app
```

## 🌐 **Result**

After successful deployment, your TIPM v3.0 will be available at:
**https://huggingface.co/spaces/thegeekybeng/tipm-app**

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **Wait Time**: HF Spaces take 2-3 minutes to build and deploy after push
2. **Authentication**: Ensure you're logged in with `hf auth login` before starting
3. **File Names**: Must be exactly `app.py` and `requirements.txt` for Gradio spaces
4. **Clean Up**: Always remove the temporary `tipm-app` directory after deployment
5. **Updates**: To update the space, repeat the clone → modify → commit → push process

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

- **"Repository not found"**: Check the space name and your HF username
- **"Permission denied"**: Ensure you're logged in and have access to the space
- **Build failures**: Check that `requirements.txt` has valid dependencies
- **App not loading**: Wait 3-5 minutes for initial build to complete

### **Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Check if you're logged in
hf auth whoami

# List your spaces
# (Use HF web interface - CLI doesn't support listing)

# Check space status
# Visit the space URL directly
```
