# NEW STANDARDIZED FORMULA DESIGN:
"""
Core Problem Identified:
- Singapore: 10% tariff showing 55% economic impact due to pre-set sector_impacts (technology: 85%, financial_services: 95%)
- Root cause: System uses unrealistic base disruption values independent of tariff rates

Standardized Solution:
Economic Impact = Base Sector Vulnerability * Tariff Impact Multiplier * Country Factors

Where:
- Base Sector Vulnerability: Realistic 5-20% baseline per sector (technology: 15%, financial: 8%)
- Tariff Impact Multiplier: 1 + (tariff_rate * sector_sensitivity * 2.5 supply chain amplification)
- Country Factors: Trade volume normalization and caps

Expected Results:
- Singapore (10%): ~15-20% total economic impact
- China (67%): ~50-65% total economic impact
- Proportional scaling across all countries and sectors
