TIPM: Tariff Impact Propagation Model
Hugging Face Spaces Deployment - Gradio Version with Standardized Formula

ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL UPDATE: This deployment includes the standardized economic impact formula
that fixes the mathematical inconsistency where Singapore (10% tariff) showed 55% impact.

âœ… New Results:
- Singapore (10%): ~15.8% impact (realistic and proportional)
- China (67%): ~40.6% impact (properly scaled)
- All countries use the same standardized calculation
